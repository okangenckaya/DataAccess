# SOLID,every software develport has to know, is basic principles. These principles aim to prevent code repeat and develop some softwares flexible, obvious, sustanible and reusable.

# SOLID is consist of 5 main titles:

# S- Single Responsibility Principle
# O- Open/Closed Principle
# L- Liskov Substitution Principle
# I- Interface Segregation Principle
# D- Dependency Inversion Principle

# S- Single Responsibility Principle= one class or object could be changed for one aim; every class has to be only used for one target. Besides, we don't fall into the coding repeat.

# O- Open/Closed Principle = It remarks that a particular code remains open for extension. However, it is closed for modification.
# As a result of this, it states we are able to add more functions,but we can't change the code existed before.

# L- Liskov Substitution Principle = it specifies while we have base class and derived class, these classes can be changed as long as we don't get incorrect results.
# Base class must enables derived class to get everything that's in the parent class so that derived class could extend from it.

# I- Interface Segregation Principle = it is explained that an interface shouldn't be useless and functionless. Therefore, objects must contain useful and functioning methods.

# D- Dependency Inversion Principle = it is pointed out that high-level modules should not be based on low-level modules. In addition to this, they both must depend on abstractions.
